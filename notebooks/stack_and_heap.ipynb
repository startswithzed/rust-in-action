    "### Stack Frame\n",
    "Stack is called stack because the entries are made in LIFO manner. These entries are called stack frames. Stack frames are created as function calls are made. A cursor within the CPU keeps track of the current stack frame. It's called the stack pointer. Stack frames contain a function's state during the call. Older function's values are effectively frozen in time. The stack frame contains space for its function’s arguments, a pointer to the original call site, and local variables (except the data which is allocated on the heap).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack's primary role is to make space for local variables. It's fast because all of a function's variables are side by side in memeory. That speeds up access."

Other than types that grow and shrink in size at runtime, there are other types with unknown size at compile time known as dynamically sized types. Slices are a common example. Heap has no assicataion with the heap datastructure. It's just an area of memory. Heap is not completely disorganized in terms of memory alloction. There is some sense of organization.\n",
