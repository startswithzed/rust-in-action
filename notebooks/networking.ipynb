    "HTTP is an application-level protocol. Its job is to transport content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebAssembly modules, images, video, and other formats. These formats often include other embedded formats via compression and encoding standards. HTTP itself often redundantly includes information provided by one of the layers below it, TCP. Between HTTP and TCP sits TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security), which has replaced SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), adds the S to HTTPS.\n",
