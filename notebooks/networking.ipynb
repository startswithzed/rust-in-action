Analogies to frame include a packet, wrapper, and envelope. \n",

    "Unicast addresses are intended to transport information between two points that are in direct contact (say, between a laptop and a router). Wireless access points complicate matters somewhat but don’t change the fundamentals. A multicast address can be accepted by multiple recipients, whereas unicast has a single recipient. The term unicast is somewhat misleading, though. Sending an Ethernet packet involves more than two devices. Using a unicast address alters what devices do when they receive packets but not which data is transmitted over the wire (or through the radio waves)."
