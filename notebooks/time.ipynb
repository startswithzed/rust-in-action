Software does not tolerate these imperfections. Most systems assume that most seconds have an equal duration. The mismatch presents several problems."

    "- **Real-time clock** — A physical clock that’s embedded in the computer’s motherboard, which keeps time when the power is off. It’s also known as the CMOS clock.\n",
    "- **System clock** — The operating system’s view of the time. Upon boot, the OS takes over timekeeping duties from the real-time clock. All applications derive their idea of time from the system time. The system clock experiences jumps, as it can be manually set to a different position. This jumpiness can confuse some applications.\n",
    "- **Monotonically increasing** — A clock that never provides the same time twice. The system clock is not monotonically increasing.\n",
    "- **Steady clock** — This clock provides two guarantees: its seconds are all equal length and it is monotonically increasing. Although potentially useless for knowing the absolute time, these are handy for calculating the duration between two points in time.\n",
    "- **High accuracy** — A clock is highly accurate if the length of its seconds are regular. The difference between two clocks is known as skew. Highly accurate clocks have little skew against the atomic clocks that are humanity’s best engineering effort at keeping accurate time.\n",
    "- **High resolution** — Provides accuracy down to 10 nanoseconds or below. High resolution clocks are typically implemented within CPU chips. Their units of work are measured in cycles, and cycles have the same duration. A 1 GHz CPU core takes 1 nanosecond to compute one cycle."
