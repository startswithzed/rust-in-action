    "To spawn a thread in rust we pass an anonymous function to `std::thread::spawn()`. When the spawned thread wants to access the variables in the parent scope, called a capture, rust want that captures be moved into the closure. It wants the closures to take the ownership using `move` keyword. This is because Closures spawned in subthreads can potentially outlive their calling scope so to make sure the accessing the data is valid the ownership has to be moved to the closure itself."

    "- Program - A program, or application, is a name that we use to refer to a software package. When we execute a program, the OS creates a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executable - A file that can be loaded into memory and then run. Running an executable means creating a process and a thread for it, then changing the CPU’s instruction pointer to the first instruction of the executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task - Task cab be used for a number of things. When discussing processes, a task is one of the process’s threads. When referring to a thread, a task might be a function call. When referring to an OS, a task might be a running program, which might be comprised of multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process - Running programs execute as processes. A process has its own virtual address space, at least one thread, and lots of bookkeeping managed by the OS. File descriptors, environment variables, and scheduling priorities are managed per process. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads. Running programs begin their life as a single process, but it isn’t uncommon to spawn subprocesses to do the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thread of execution - A sequence of CPU instructions that appear in serial. Multiple threads can run concurrently, but instructions within the sequence are intended to be executed one after another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coroutine - Also known as fibre, green thread, and lightweight thread, a coroutine indicates tasks that switch within a thread. Switching between tasks becomes the responsibility of the program itself, rather than the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-blocking I/O - Normally a thread is unscheduled when it asks for data from I/O devices like the network. The thread is marked as blocked, while it waits for data to arrive. When programming with non-blocking I/O, the thread can continue executing even while it waits for data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Asynchronous programming - Asynchronous programming describes programming for cases where the control flow is not predetermined. Instead, events outside the control of the program itself impact the sequence of what is executed. Those events are typically related to I/O, such as a device driver signalling that it is ready, or are related to functions returning in another thread. The asynchronous programming model is typically more complicated for the developer, but results in a faster runtime for I/O-heavy workloads. Speed increases because there are fewer system calls. This implies fewer context switches between the user space and the kernel space."
